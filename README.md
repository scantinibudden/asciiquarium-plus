Kirk Baucom's [Asciiquarium](https://robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/) with a few additions. The castle's spot on the sea floor now holds something that sank, and the shark, whale and the rest take turns in order with a pause between them.

It is still a single Perl script, and the original is left alone apart from these changes.

## What's new

- **Sunken decorations.** A treasure chest, a skull or an anchor sits where the castle used to. By default each scene picks one at random (a new one on every redraw), and `-d castle` brings the castle back.
- **Events take turns.** The shark, fish hook, ship, dolphins, big fish, ducks, sea monster, swan and whale appear one at a time in that fixed order and loop forever, starting from a random one. After each one leaves, the sea stays calm for a shared cooldown (`-e`, 30 seconds by default).

## The sea floor

           \     /
            `-.-'

## Usage

```sh
asciiquarium                  # random sunken decoration, 30 s between events
asciiquarium -d skull         # always the skull
asciiquarium -e 0             # no quiet time: events back to back
asciiquarium -d castle -e 90  # the classic castle, calmer sea
```

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-d random\|anchor\|castle\|skull\|treasure` | what sits on the sea floor | `random` (anchor, skull or treasure) |
| `-e <seconds>` | cooldown between events, whole seconds | `30` |

While it runs:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | quit |
| `p` | pause / resume |
| `r` | redraw (recreates everything and picks a new random decoration) |

A new scene opens with a random event right away; the cooldown applies between events after that.

## Configuration

To change the defaults without typing flags every time, create `~/.config/asciiquarium-plus/config` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/asciiquarium-plus/config`):

```ini
# asciiquarium-plus
decoration = skull   # random, anchor, castle, skull or treasure
cooldown = 60        # seconds between events
```

Flags override the file, and the file overrides the built-in defaults (`random`, `30`). The file is only ever read, never written, and it can't break anything:

- a missing, empty or unreadable file means the defaults
- an empty or unknown `decoration` means `random`
- a `cooldown` that isn't a whole number means `30`
- unknown keys and junk lines are ignored

## Install

The script needs Perl 5 with the [Curses](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curses) and [Term::Animation](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::Animation) modules. It runs anywhere curses does (Linux, macOS, BSD, WSL), but not natively on Windows.

**macOS (Homebrew).** The `asciiquarium` formula already bundles both modules, built for the system Perl, so run the script with `/usr/bin/perl` (a Homebrew `perl` on your `PATH` can't load them):

```sh
brew install asciiquarium
git clone https://github.com/scantinibudden/asciiquarium-plus.git
cd asciiquarium-plus
PERL5LIB="$(brew --prefix asciiquarium)/libexec/lib/perl5" /usr/bin/perl ./asciiquarium
```

**Debian / Ubuntu**

```sh
sudo apt-get install libcurses-perl cpanminus
sudo cpanm Term::Animation
git clone https://github.com/scantinibudden/asciiquarium-plus.git
cd asciiquarium-plus && sudo make install   # installs to /usr/local/bin/asciiquarium
```

**Anywhere else:** install the two modules with `cpan Curses Term::Animation`, then run `./asciiquarium` or `make install PREFIX=~/.local`.

## Development

```sh
make test   # prove t/: compiles, CLI validation, config fallbacks, art/colour-mask alignment, event order
make lint   # perlcritic (gentle, see .perlcriticrc)
```

CI runs both on Linux and runs the tests on macOS.

To add a decoration, write an `add_<name>` sub like `add_treasure` (an image and a colour mask of the same shape) and register it in `%decorations`. It automatically joins the random pool, and `t/art.t` checks that its mask lines up with the art.
